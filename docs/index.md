Aligns sparse plug-based measurements (e.g., TOC, porosity, XRD
mineralogy) to a high-resolution reference depth grid (e.g., HHXRF)
using rule-based one-dimensional interpolation without extrapolation.
Produces depth-consistent tables for stratigraphic comparison,
visualization, and chemofacies/reservoir-quality analysis.
