Description: Implements the Stratigraphic Plug Alignment (SPA) procedure
    for integrating sparsely sampled plug-based measurements (e.g., total
    organic carbon, porosity, mineralogy) with high-resolution X-ray
    fluorescence (XRF) geochemical data. SPA uses linear interpolation via
    the base 'approx()' function with constrained extrapolation ('rule = 1')
    to preserve stratigraphic order and avoid estimation beyond observed
    depths. The method aligns all datasets to a common depth grid, enabling
    high-resolution multivariate analysis and stratigraphic interpretation
    of core-based datasets such as those from the Utica and Point Pleasant
    formations.
