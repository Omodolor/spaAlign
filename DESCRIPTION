Description: Implements the Stratigraphic Plug Alignment (SPA) procedure 
    for integrating sparsely sampled plug-based measurements (e.g., total 
    organic carbon, porosity, mineralogy) with high-resolution X-ray 
    fluorescence (XRF) geochemical data. SPA uses linear interpolation via 
    the base "approx()" function with constrained extrapolation ("rule = 1") 
    to preserve stratigraphic order and avoid estimation beyond observed 
    depths. The method aligns all datasets to a common depth grid, enabling 
    high-resolution multivariate analysis and stratigraphic interpretation 
    of core-based datasets such as those from the Utica and Point Pleasant 
    formations.
