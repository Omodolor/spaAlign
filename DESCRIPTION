Description: Implements the Stratigraphic Plug Alignment (SPA) procedure for
    integrating sparsely sampled plug-based measurements (e.g., total organic
    carbon, porosity, mineralogy) with high-resolution X-ray fluorescence
    (XRF) geochemical data. SPA uses linear interpolation via the base
    approx() function with constrained extrapolation (rule = 1) to preserve
    stratigraphic order and avoid estimation beyond observed depths. The
    method aligns all datasets to a common depth grid, enabling high-resolution
    multivariate analysis and stratigraphic interpretation of core-based
    datasets such as those from the Utica and Point Pleasant formations.
